# Stocks-Price-Prediction

Here I have taken the data of New York Stock Exchange and have consttructed an Deep Learning model to predict the future stock price of Apple.

I have used TenserFlow and Keras for the Deep Learning Model.

Using keras I contructed 4 layer neural network with 100 epochs for training it.

I have obtained results with
\bigin{center}Train Score:
MSE: 0.00019 , RMSE: 0.01
Validation Score:
MSE: 0.00043 , RMSE: 0.02
Test Score:
MSE: 0.00028 , RMSE: 0.02\end{center}

Thank you!
